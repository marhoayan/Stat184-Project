# Stat184-Project

This project analyzed historical UEFA Champions League data to identify the most dominant countries and clubs in both the men's and women's tournaments. The analysis revealed that Spain, England, and Italy lead the men's league in total titles, while Germany, France, and Spain dominate on the women's side. Notably, Real Madrid and Olympique Lyonnais have significantly contributed to their countries' success in their respective competitions.
I used the BOAST style guide to write my code.
